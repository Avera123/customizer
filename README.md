# Welcome to the IBM Connections Customizer Repository 

## What's Here?
### 1. Documentation
IBM Connections Customizer is a new service for modifying the IBM Connections user experience. Detailed [documentation][1] on all aspects of Customizer is available in the docs folder. 

### 2. Samples
All the Customizer samples referred to in the [documentation][1] are available here in the [samples folder][2]. Other supplemental enablement videos are available online on this [YouTube channel][8].

### 3. IBM Connections Customizer GA   
Customizer is now generally available on IBM Connections Cloud for tenants of the North America and Europe data centres. Before using Customizer your organization must first register for the service by sending a mail to `ibmcndev@us.ibm.com`. The email should include your `name`, `organization name` and `organization id`. Trial organizations are also eligible to use Customizer and can register in the same way.
If you have already participated in the Customizer pilot program *you do not need to re-apply* as your organization is automatically enabled for the GA release. **NOTE** - for pilot participants who wish to continue to use applications created during the pilot phase, you must migrate these applications to the production environment. This is a simple process which is explained [here][9].

### 5. Provide Feedback
Any bugs, feature requests and other observations should be reported as [issues][3] in this repository.
